# Hartree-Fock-H2

Solution of the Hartree-Fock equations for the Hydrogen molecule using 1s orbitals in the STO-3G basis. The notebooks are based on the [Nickel and Copper playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDAfpQIMde0&list=PL-hN8vfRaU7jSFHN1ZSAMNe_2nXhwAmzM) whose notebook can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/nickelandcopper/HartreeFockPythonProgram.git) What's new here is that the notebooks include the theoretical calculations behind the implementation, which are very important to follow the workflow.
